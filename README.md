Simple Weather Website
A lightweight and responsive weather website built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates the power of vanilla web technologies to create a functional and visually appealing weather application.

How It Works
This weather website fetches data from a public weather API using JavaScript. It then dynamically updates the DOM to display current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a 5-day forecast. The site is styled using custom CSS, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.

Future Improvements
Add more detailed weather information
Implement geolocation for automatic local weather
Create a dark mode option
Add weather maps and radar functionality
